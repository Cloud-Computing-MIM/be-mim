# Backend Repository for MIM Project

## Description

This repository contains the TypeScript-based backend for the MIM project, built using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework. It handles API endpoints, authentication, and database interactions. The backend is designed to provide a secure and scalable solution for managing the project's data and functionality.

## Features

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implements JWT-based authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for admin users.
- **Supabase Integration**: Leverages Supabase for user management and database interactions.
- **Environment Configuration**: Securely manages environment variables using the `@nestjs/config` module.
- **RESTful API**: Provides structured and well-documented API endpoints.
- **Modular Architecture**: Ensures maintainability and scalability through a modular file structure.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Designed to be deployed on AWS for high availability and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the backend, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher.
